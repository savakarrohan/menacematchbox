        is credited for coining the term Machine learning when he programmed a
        computer to beat people at checkers. While today the mathematics for
        machine learning is well structured using terms such as states, neural
        networks, weights, actions & cumulative rewards. The concepts used to
        teach machines is very much similar to concepts to teach animals (humans
        & pets). These concepts are so simple that it baffles me how can such
        simple ideas have a profound effect.

        extreme interest in teaching computers to learn. Learning for a computer
        could be considered to perform tasks without any explicit instruction.
